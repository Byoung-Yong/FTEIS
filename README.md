# FTEIS dataset for machine learning

#### The complete dataset was acquired from +0.3 V through -0.8 V at every 10 mV, therefore, the data number starts from 1 to 110. 
#### However, the potential range of the significant data spans from 0.1 V through -0.6 V according to the cyclic voltammogram, 
#### we selected the impedance data from 20 to 89 for machine learning.

### Each file has three columns without headers nor comments for convenience. 
* The first column shows frequency in Hz, 
* the second column shows the real number of the complex impedance spectrum in Ohm, and 
* the last column shows the imaginary number of the complex impedance spectrum in Ohm.
